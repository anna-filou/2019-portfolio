### Traditional websites are a lot of work to maintain.
You need to pay for a server every month, forever to host a site built on Wordpress or other Content Management Systems (CMS). That server needs to work all the time, build the website from the ground up every time there's a new visitor. Unless you're building something very complex, like a social network, that's not at all necessary.

Static sites on the other hand don't require a CMS. No server to pay for, no updates to install, no viruses to worry about.Â But how to you update the content?

That's where static site *generators* come in. They update the website only once when you add new content; not many times, one for each visitor. That makes the website faster, cheaper to maintain (as in totally **free**) and it will always work, no matter where you put it.
