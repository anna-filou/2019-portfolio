## 🎯 Focusing on (current obsessions)
- Jekyll (static site generator)
- Airtable databases, back-office automation (honestly much more exciting than it sounds)

## 🤓 Learning
- Webflow
- Liquid templating language (for Jekyll)
- Airtable - advanced integrations

---

## 📚 Reading
- Lots of articles on Instapaper (let's me speed read and has built-in Wiktionary support, so I prefer it over Pocket)
